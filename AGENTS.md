# Workspace Orchestration Rules

Generated by ChatGPT (Codex) at: 2026-02-25 21:42:24 KST

## Scope

This repository has multiple data pipelines. The root `AGENTS.md` defines shared rules only.
Task-specific requirements must be read from each pipeline directory's `AGENTS.md`.

- Notion pipeline:
  - `agents/notion_data_reader/agents.md`
- Tistory pipeline:
  - `agents/tistory_data_reader/AGENTS.md`
- Github data poster:
  - `agents/github_data_poster/agents.md`
## Global Rules (All Pipelines)

- Do not start bulk extraction until the user explicitly says to start.
- Confirm output root directory once before first bulk run.
- Make all runs resumable:
  - Skip already completed posts/pages unless user requests re-run.
  - Avoid duplicate image downloads when files already exist.
- Never store credentials in files or commit history.
- Keep source order in `content.txt` and preserve inline image markers at original positions.
- Use deterministic image filenames (`img-001`, `img-002`, ...).
- Report run summary:
  - processed count
  - skipped count
  - failed count with URLs

## Conflict Resolution

- If root rule and pipeline-specific rule conflict:
  - follow pipeline-specific `AGENTS.md` for that task scope.
- Do not mix Notion and Tistory naming/output conventions in the same run.

## Execution Model

- Prefer staged execution for large jobs:
  - pilot batch
  - validation
  - full run with resume mode
