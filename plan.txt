so currently my goal is to write down the blogs and commit to the github repository.
(note the picuture should be appended inside the blog appropriately, it could be screeshor or png file.
also there are bunch of commands and codes to append)

anyway my goal is to write down the whole process and knowledges about agentic AI.
so the framework and diagram that in my head is as follows:

Larget two topic: Theory and Applications.

1. Theory
    1a. Defintion of Agentic AI (compare to the generateive ai and the LLM)
    1b. Structure of Agentic AI
        - LLM, Memory, Tool, skills, MCP, subagents, etc.
2. Applications
    2a. Command Line Interface(CLI)
        - codex, claude code, gemini
    2b. Desktop
        - codex, claude code (& cowork)
    2c. Web Application
        - chatgpt, claude, gemini, etc.
    2d. Integrated Development Environment(IDE)
        - Cursor, VS code, anti-gravity, etc.
